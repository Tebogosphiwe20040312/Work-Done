    <h3>Disadvantages of PHP</h3>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px;fontfamily: Arial;">
        <li>Security Concerns – Because it's open-source, vulnerabilities can exist if not properly managed.</li>
        <li>Performance Issues – PHP may not be as fast as languages like Python or Java for complex applications.</li>
        <li>Less Modern Approach – Some developers prefer newer frameworks that provide advanced features.</li>
        <li>Inconsistent Naming Conventions: Historically, PHP's function names can sometimes feel a bit inconsistent.
        </li>
        <li>Can Lead to Messy Code (if not careful): Because PHP is so flexible and easy to embed directly into HTML,
            beginners can sometimes end up writing code that is less organized and harder to maintain as the website
            grows. </li>
    </ul>
